I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.mrc.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen). 
Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in microelectronics science and engineering from [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), in 2020.

My current research interests primarily include efficient AI computing with emerging technology (photonics) and VLSI design automation.
