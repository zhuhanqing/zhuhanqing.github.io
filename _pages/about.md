I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.mrc.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen).
I work closely with Prof. [Zhangyang "Atlas" Wang](https://express.adobe.com/page/CAdrFMJ9QeI2y/) at UT Austin and Prof. [Jiaqi Gu](http://www.jqgu.net/) at ASU.

Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in microelectronics science and engineering from [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with highest honor, in 2020.

My current research interests primarily center on efficient AI computing, from emerging AI systems to hardware-aware/system-aware AI algorithms.
* Hardware-Software Co-Design for Emerging AI Hardware and Computing Systems.
* Efficient Training and Inference Techniques for Vision Models and Large-Scale Foundation Models.
