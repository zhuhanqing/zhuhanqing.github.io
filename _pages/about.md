I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) and Prof. [Ray T. Chen](http://www.mrc.utexas.edu/people/faculty/ray-chen). 
Previously, I received the B.Eng. degree in microelectronics science and engineering from [Shanghai Jiaotong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) with highest honor, in 2020.

My current research interests primarily include efficient and robust AI computing systems with emerging technology (photonics), efficient machine learning, and machine learning for VLSI design automation.
